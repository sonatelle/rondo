## Installing

```sh
brew install --cask sonatelle/tap/rondo
```

Or download the disk image below, open it, and drag Rondo to Applications.

Rondo is ad-hoc signed and not notarized, because notarizing needs a paid
Apple Developer ID, which this project does not have. The two routes differ
in who deals with that.

The disk image leaves it to you. macOS stops the first launch, and how you
get past it depends on the version: on macOS 14 it is **right-click the app,
then Open**, and confirm once; macOS 15 removed that route, so open the app,
let it be refused, then go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, find
the notice near the bottom, and press **Open Anyway**. Either way it is
asked once.

[The tap](https://github.com/sonatelle/homebrew-tap) settles it for you
instead: the cask clears the quarantine attribute Homebrew applies, so the
app opens straight away. That is a real waiver of Gatekeeper's check for
this one app, made without asking - worth knowing before taking the shorter
command.

It runs on Apple Silicon Macs, macOS 14 or later. There is no Intel build.

Rondo keeps its data in a local SQLite file and makes no network requests
of any kind.
